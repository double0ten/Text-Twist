## [Text-Twist](https://ide.c9.io/zhangqx/project22)

This project setup a simple web app with four major functions: 
1. A registration system, 
2. A login system, 
3. A change password page, and 
4. after successful login show the user all previous login times. Allow registration in two ways: password and OAuth service with Github. This project is based on Node, Express, and Mongo. 
5. after that, we try our best to make the whole project as secure as we can do.

### How to run

You can run the project directly in our workspace. The github authorization module is only work in our workspace (because github OAuth apps needs a fixed authorization callback URL).

### For more information, please infer readme.
